# JasmineRice ReRunner

This is a Google Chrome extension that fetches the failing specs from
a Jasmine Rice spec runner and opens a new tab for each one.

The extension is available through chrome extensions:

Don't forget to allow the extension to run in incognito mode if you want to run your specs in incognito mode and still have access to the extension.

JasmineRice is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code and it is available here:
